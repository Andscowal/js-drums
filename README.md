# js-drums

This project is a tutorial done through Wes Bos' JavaScript30 challenge.

I decided to include it to demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript. Particularly when it comes to interfacing with the DOM 
and the integration of audio elements into an application.

Thank you for stopping by and happy coding!
